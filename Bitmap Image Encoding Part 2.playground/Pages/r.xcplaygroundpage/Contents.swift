 # Introduction
 Recall that earlier this year we learned one way that computers can encode *bitmaps*, or images, in an efficient manner:
 
 ![letter_a](letter_a.png "Letter A")
 
 For a refresher, the way this works is:
 
 * Each pixel is filled with either black or white.
 * When a line starts with a 0, the first pixel is black.
 * Otherwise, the first pixel is white.
 * What a pixel is filled with alternates from one number to the next.
 * The number indicates how many pixels should be filled with the current colour.
 
 With this playground you will finish learning how to use conditional statements and loops to decode and render an encoded bitmap.
